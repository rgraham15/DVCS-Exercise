    <h1>My Summer</h1>
    <p>This was also my third year going to Pierce Lake. We got to go fishing, and tubing and wakeboarding. I finally figured out how to get up on a wake board and was able to turn once I got up. I didn’t catch a fish, but my boyfriend Evan let me reel one of his in. We also went blue berry picking and saw a bear!</p>
